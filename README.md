# Automated-planning-Robot-solver
This project focuses on the development and empirical evaluation of an automated planning system for a domain consisting of a robot navigating a grid-based maze containing walls, boxes, keys, doors and labelled drop zones, with the objective of delivering each box to its corresponding drop zone while respecting action preconditions and constraints.
